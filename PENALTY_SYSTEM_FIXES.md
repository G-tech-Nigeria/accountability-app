# Penalty System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Penalty Calculation Not Working
**Problem**: The penalty system was not automatically calculating penalties for missed tasks. It only showed existing penalties in storage.

**Solution**: 
- Added `calculateMissedTaskPenalties()` function in `src/utils/storage.js`
- This function automatically calculates penalties for missed tasks on a given date
- Penalties are distributed among other users
- Integrated automatic penalty calculation in Dashboard and DailyTasks components

### 2. Date Manipulation Vulnerability
**Problem**: Users could change their system date to avoid penalties.

**Solution**:
- Added automatic penalty calculation for past dates (last 7 days) in Dashboard
- Added manual penalty recalculation feature in Settings
- Penalties are calculated when viewing past dates in DailyTasks

### 3. Missing Previous Day Tasks View
**Problem**: No way to view tasks from previous days.

**Solution**:
- Added date picker navigation in DailyTasks component
- Users can navigate between dates using arrow buttons
- Shows "Today", "Yesterday", or formatted date
- Displays penalty summary for the selected date

## New Features Added

### 1. Automatic Penalty Calculation
- Penalties are automatically calculated when viewing past dates
- Dashboard checks last 7 days for missed tasks on load
- Penalties are distributed among all other users

### 2. Manual Penalty Recalculation
- New button in Settings page: "Recalculate Missed Task Penalties"
- Recalculates penalties for the last 30 days
- Useful for catching up on missed penalties

### 3. Date Navigation
- Arrow buttons to navigate between dates in DailyTasks
- Shows penalty summary for the selected date
- Displays total penalties for the date

### 4. Enhanced Penalty Display
- Penalty summary shows in DailyTasks for the selected date
- Dashboard shows total penalties per user
- Better visual indicators for penalties

## How to Test

### Test 1: Basic Penalty Calculation
1. Create tasks for yesterday
2. Leave some tasks incomplete
3. Navigate to yesterday in DailyTasks
4. Check if penalties are calculated automatically
5. Verify penalties appear in Dashboard

### Test 2: Date Manipulation Protection
1. Change your system date to yesterday
2. Create tasks and leave them incomplete
3. Change your system date back to today
4. Go to Settings and click "Recalculate Missed Task Penalties"
5. Check if penalties are calculated correctly

### Test 3: Previous Day Navigation
1. Create tasks for different days
2. Use the date navigation arrows in DailyTasks
3. Verify you can see tasks from previous days
4. Check that penalty summaries update for each date

### Test 4: Manual Recalculation
1. Create some missed tasks from the past week
2. Go to Settings
3. Click "Recalculate Missed Task Penalties"
4. Verify new penalties are created

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `src/utils/storage.js` - Added penalty calculation functions
2. `src/pages/DailyTasks.jsx` - Added date navigation and penalty display
3. `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` - Added automatic penalty calculation
4. `src/pages/Settings.jsx` - Added manual penalty recalculation

### New Functions:
- `calculateMissedTaskPenalties(date)` - Calculates penalties for missed tasks
- `getTasksForDateRange(startDate, endDate)` - Gets tasks for date range
- `getDatesWithTasks()` - Gets all dates that have tasks

## Technical Details

### Penalty Calculation Logic:
1. Get all tasks for the specified date
2. Group tasks by user
3. Find missed tasks (status: 'pending' or 'missed')
4. Calculate total penalty amount (missed tasks Ã— penalty amount)
5. Distribute penalties among other users
6. Create penalty records in storage

### Date Handling:
- Uses ISO date strings (YYYY-MM-DD) for consistency
- Compares dates properly using Date objects
- Handles timezone issues by setting hours to 0

### Storage:
- Penalties are stored with unique IDs
- Prevents duplicate penalties for the same date/user combination
- Maintains penalty history for tracking

## Future Improvements

1. **Real-time Penalty Updates**: Update penalties in real-time when tasks are completed
2. **Penalty History**: Add a dedicated page to view penalty history
3. **Penalty Settings**: Allow users to configure penalty amounts per task
4. **Penalty Notifications**: Send notifications when penalties are incurred
5. **Penalty Payment Tracking**: Track when penalties are paid
